# memeta

Memeta is a collaborative learning platform. Students can create flashcards which Memeta presents to them in subsequent training sessions. 

In contrast to other such platforms, Memeta prompts students to make metacognitive judgements while learning the material on the flashcards, i.e.
students are invited to not only learn the material, but while doing so also think about how they learn, how their memory works etc.

At the moment, only a very rudimentary prototype of this idea is realised, but I intend to flesh it out more in the months to come.
